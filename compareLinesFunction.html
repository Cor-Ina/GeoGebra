function areLinesSame(line1, line2) {
    // Parse the line equations to get the slope and y-intercept
    let line1Slope = getSlope(line1);
    let line1Intercept = getIntercept(line1);
    let line2Slope = getSlope(line2);
    let line2Intercept = getIntercept(line2);
  
    // Compare the slopes and y-intercepts
    return line1Slope === line2Slope && line1Intercept === line2Intercept;
  }
  
  function getSlope(line) {
    // Extract the slope from the line equation
    // ...
  }
  
  function getIntercept(line) {
    // Extract the y-intercept from the line equation
    // ...
  }
  Note that the implementation of getSlope and getIntercept functions will depend on the format of the line equation input by the user. You may need to write some code to parse the equation and extract the slope and y-intercept.
